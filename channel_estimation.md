# Channel Estimation
When you transmit a wireless signal over the air lots of bad things happen to it that the receiver needs to be able to deal with. The signal gets partially reflected off surfaces, bounces off buildings, parts of it get absorbed by walls or trees -- this is called multipath propagation. In order to deal with this on the receiver end one must perform channel estimation so that these distortions can be reversed as much as possible so that all them juicy 1's and 0's could be received without error.
